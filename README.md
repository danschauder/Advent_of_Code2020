# Advent_of_Code2020
I've chosen to participate in this year's Advent of Code challenge. The organizers of the event post a 2-part coding challenge for each of the 25 days leading up to Christmas.

This repo contains my solutions to the challenges. All of these are written in Python. As a first pass, I've attempted to complete the challenges as quickly as possible to
produce an "MVP"... I may decide to revisit these to create more robust implementations, pay more attention to time/space complexity analysis, and generally improve readability,
but my main objective is to have some fun and to keep my problem-solving skills sharp.
